* In which gauges do we want to implement the interactions
-> If it's Newtonian only we should add a check at the beginning of "perturb_init"

* check output in CAMB format if there is no nudm component
-> does it rise a segmentation fault?
-> is there a wrongly assigend nudm column title ?

* in function "perturb_vector_init"
